//! Named scalar caveats.

//! The mint is caveat-vocabulary-agnostic (see `docs/design-mint.md`
//! § *Macaroon caveat conventions*): it does not hard-code which caveat
//! names are meaningful. A caveat is a `(name, value)` pair; **every
//! caveat is scalar**. There is no list-valued caveat type — the only
//! list-shaped input a role ever needed (the `volume-ro` ancestor set)
//! rides the PoP-signed request body as `request.ancestors`, not the
//! caveat chain (design-mint.md § *All caveats are scalar*). This keeps
//! the macaroon library to scalar caveats plus the holder-of-key
//! extension, with no chain whose effective value depends on
//! occurrence order.
